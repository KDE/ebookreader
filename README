TabletReader is an e-book reader for touch enabled devices.
Written into C++ and QML using Qt framework, tabletReader 
is targeted at Linux OSs, but Windows is also supported
(see https://github.com/cristeab/tabletReader).

Required dependencies:
- Qt >= 4.7
- QtMobility >= 1.2
- okular core library
- chmlib

This version makes extensive use of okular core library for reading 
e-documents. However, chmlib is still used in order to correctly handle
chm documents.

Compilation and installation (Linux only):
1. create a folder below the application root folder: 'mkdir build'
2. change current directory to that folder: 'cd build'
3. generate make files using the default build type and the
   default installation path (see Notes section): 'cmake ..'
4. compile application (make)
5. install application (sudo make install)  

Notes:
- Build types (use 'cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release'):
 * Release: default build type, the application is compiled in release 
   mode with support for touch-enabled devices running Plasma notebook 
   (KDE) on Linux (tested on openSUSE 12.1)
 * DesktopRelease: same as Release build type, but the support for 
   Plasma desktop is enabled (tested on openSUSE 12.1)
 * Debug: application is compiled in debug mode with support for
   Plasma notebook. A log file (tabletReader.log) is created in the 
   home folder of the current user
 * DesktopDebug: same as Debug build type, but the support for
   Plasma desktop is enabled
- Installation path:
 * Default installation path is '/usr/local/bin'
 * Change the installation path with 'cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr' 
   (install the application in '/usr/bin')
