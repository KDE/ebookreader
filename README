tabletReader is an e-book reader for touch enabled devices
It is written into C++ and QML using Qt framework. Initially it has been sought 
as an e-book reader for Linux OSs, but Windows is also supported. Currently,
an Windows installer for version 2.0 has been submitted to Intel AppUp
(http://www.appup.com/app-details/tabletReader).

Dependencies:
- Qt >= 4.7
- QtMobility >= 1.2
- qt-poppler
- chmlib
- djvulibre

Compilation and installation:
- Windows: use the solution file provided for Visual Studio 2010
- Linux: use qmake in the root folder, then make and make install

Notes:
- by default the application is compiled in release mode, with 
support for touch-enabled devices running Plasma notebook (KDE) on Linux 
(tested on openSUSE 12.1)
- for Plasma desktop (KDE) you might need to define DESKTOP_APP
in src/src.pro
