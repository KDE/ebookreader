TabletReader is an e-book reader for touch enabled devices.
Written into C++ and QML using Qt framework, tabletReader 
is targeted at Linux OSs, but Windows is also supported
(see https://projects.kde.org/projects/playground/edu/ebookreader).

Required dependencies:
- Qt >= 4.7
- okular core library

Compilation and installation:
Linux
1. create a folder below the application root folder: 'mkdir build'
2. change current directory to that folder: 'cd build'
3. generate make files using the default build type and the
   default installation path (see Notes section): 'cmake ..'
4. compile application (make)
5. install application (sudo make install)
Windows
1. compile KDE for Windows and okular
2. use cmake GUI in order to generate Visual Studio project files (tested with 
Visual Studio 2010)
3. compile the application using tabletReader project
4. for installation:
 4.1 copy the generated binary to the bin folder found in the KDE for Windows root folder or
 4.2 use the binary generated by 'package' project (Nullsoft Scriptable Install System is needed)

Notes:
- Build types (use 'cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release'):
 * Release: default build type, the application is compiled in release 
   mode with support for touch-enabled devices running Plasma notebook 
   (KDE) on Linux
 * Debug or Debugfull: application is compiled in debug mode with support for
   Plasma notebook. A log file (tabletReader.log) is created in the 
   home folder of the current user
- Compilation on desktop systems:
 * In order to compile the application on a desktop system running Linux, please set to true 
 the DESKTOP_APP switch:
 'cmake .. -DDESKTOP_APP=true'
- Installation path:
 * Default installation path is '/usr/local/bin'
 * Change the installation path with 'cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr' 
   (install the application in '/usr/bin')
